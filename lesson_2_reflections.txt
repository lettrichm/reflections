What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a hidden folder where commits will go.  Without running init, the 
folder would not exist.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where things wait to be added to the repository.  It 
allows you to work on several things and add them to the staging area from
the working directory without yet creating a commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?
I really need to dig deeper into the purpose of the staging area, and what 
benefits it provides
